            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                During our community visits in Hubli, we encountered various social issues affecting the local population. A significant problem is the lack of support for individuals aspiring to start their own small home-based businesses. Many face obstacles due to limited access to essential services and a shortage of skilled labor, leading to financial difficulties.

            <h2>Identified Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Women's Welfare Awareness</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a widespread belief that a woman is solely responsible for determining the gender of a child, particularly when a girl is born. This outdated thinking places unfair blame on women, reflecting a need for better education on gender and biology.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Unemployment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unemployment is a pressing issue, with some individuals remaining jobless for many years due to insufficient skills and training. Even well-educated individuals may struggle to find employment due to personal or logistical challenges, preventing them from reaching their full potential.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Infrastructure Problems</h3>
                    <p>
                        Issues such as unsafe and improper electrical wiring installed by local authorities pose safety risks and highlight a need for greater accountability and quality control.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Financial Illiteracy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Financial illiteracy remains a barrier for many people living in slum areas. Without adequate knowledge of basic financial principles, individuals are often lured into fraudulent schemes by illegal companies, trapping them in cycles of debt and exploitation.

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
